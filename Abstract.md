NAIST is a very good place to study. It is well-established that the students do not want to study anymore. This study aims to determine how to study well at NAIST. Specifically, it investigates whether NAIST students can in fact enjoy themselves in the middle of nowhere in Nara. 

To test the hypothesis I had established,  we performed a high-quality questionnaire.
