## Experience to maintain repo: 
It is hard to maintain the repository with a lot of people and a lot of contributors. A lot of contributors come with a lot of pull requests that means the repository's owner needs to check a lot of changes file and might have to discuss with these contributors before merge to the main branch.
## Experience to review PRs: 
From the example in the class, each pull request doesn't change much so I don't feel much hard for reviewing the pull request. On the other hand for the big repositories, there will be a lot of changes in each pull request that why many repositories have rules for pull requests.

## Lessons learnt: 
This is my first time doing the pull request so It was opened my world about how and steps to become a contributor. And the class let me practice so that It makes me more clearly and also discuss the pro or con of managing/maintaining systems (as that pull request need to be reviewed first and also the doing steps on Github)

## Experience to maintain repo
The task is very time consuming if the one who try to submit PR doean't follow some convention. Tools such as GitKraken can greatly help to maintain many branches that can't be seen at GitHub.
## Experience to review PRs
In my case, I try to make sure that my PR is not conflicting with any other collaborators. If you have a conflict in your PR, the maintainer usually don't have enough time or patience to take a look at your PR.
## Lessons learnt
Tools and Convention can help collaborator and maintainer to achieve better Quality of Life. Using Edit Tools in GitHub usually can introducce an unseen problem.

## Experience to maintain repo
It is hard to manage repository for me because there are many pull requests and sometimes it occurs confliction.
Therefore there are not good pull requests like the negative sentence while I want to get positive sentence.
## Experience to review PRs
I feel review is important because some pull requests are not good for me.
If I had merged everything, it would have been messed up.
## Lessons learnt
It is difficult to manage the repository which can send pull request from many people.
I want to check some issue and whether there are same pull requests already.
I think it is more complex in OSS repository case.
I wonder why they can managed OSS repositories.

## Experience to maintain repo
It is quite interesting to keep merging while managing the conflict. Most of the time I have to fix the conflict in merging by myself (some people edit the same part of the abstract). 

## Experience to review PRs
Many people keep making pull request with a negative sentiment although my goal is to get the positive sentiment in abstract. From this, I know that the direction of the project should be clearly define in the repo.

## Lessons learnt
Although this class is just the mock-up, I feel that it is quite difficult to find people to make the pull request for my project. I think when I make my own real project I should keep to contribution.MD simple and easy to read so it can attract more people to contribute in.

## Experience to maintain repo
It was the first time for me to maintain my repository as well as to contribute other people's works.
It found it fun but it took me time to get used to the system of GitHub.
## Experience to review PRs
It was thrilling to see my abstract get contentful by pulling other students' contribution.
However, I found it was a little troublesome when there is a conflicting pull request and I had to manage them somehow.
## Lessons learnt
In these lessons I learned that, above all, it is important to ask other programmers when I seem to be stuck. Right after asking my classmate about creating a pull request, I could work on the task more efficiently.
