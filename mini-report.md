## Experience to maintain repo
It is hard to manage repository for me.
Because there are many pull requests and sometimes it occurs confliction.
Therefore there are not good pull requests like the negative sentence while I want to get positive sentence.
I think it is more complex in OSS repository case.
I wonder why they can managed OSS repositories.
## Experience to review PRs
I feel review is important because some pull requests are not good for me.
If I had merged everything, it would have been messed up.
And there are many confliction, so I managed that confliction myself.
## Lessons learnt
It is difficult to manage the repository which can send pull request from many people.
I want to check some issue and whether there are same pull requests already.
